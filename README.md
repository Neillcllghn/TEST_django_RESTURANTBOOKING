## User Experience (UX)

Tablefor2 is an online booking system that allows users of the site to register online to make/edit or cancel bookings.

The client would like users of the site to register with the site to allow for user identifcation, select times that are listed on the site so to avoid selecting out of hour periods, provide an unique email to all bookings so that the client can make contact with the user if need be (future updates to the system), plus to provide each booking as unique to avoid double booking.

#### Key information for the site:
- What is on the Menu.
- What Times are availble for booking.
- Register/Sign in page.
- How to make a booking.
- View bookings already made.
- Which bookings are pending approval (which can be edited or deleted) and approved (which can only be deleted by the user).

### User Stories

#### Client Goals:
- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To make it easy for potential customers (the user) to find out what is on offer (menu) and how to make a booking.
- To make it clear to the user what times are available for bookings.
- To allow users to view the bookings made and prevent double bookings.
- Approve bookings.

#### User/Customer Goals:
- I want to know what Tablefor2 offers in terms of a menu etc.
- I want to register an account so that I can make a booking/reservation.
- I want to make a booking by selecting a time and date for my reservation.
- I want to be able to view a list of my bookings so that I know what has been booked etc.
- I want to be able to edit a booking so that I can make changes if needed and prior to approval.
- I want to be able to cancel/delete a booking (whether it is pending approval or approved).
