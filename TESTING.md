Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. During development I made use of Google Chrome Developer Tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using Google Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. I have checked the HTML via direct input and also by inspecting the page source and running this through the validator.

* [Index Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbookworm2022.herokuapp.com%2F) - No errors or warnings.

### W3C CSS Validator

No errors were found when passing through the official (jigsaw) validator. Link can be found [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

### JavaScript Validator

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript.
